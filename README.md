# Games with p5.js

This repository contains a variety of examples of a different kind built with p5.js.

Inspiration for most of them came from the work of [Daniel Shiffman](http://twitter.com/shiffman) and his channel on Youtube call [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw).

I used materials from the Udemy's course [How to Program Games: Tile Classics in JS for HTML5 Canvas](https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-program-games/) taught by [Chris DeLeon](https://hometeamgamedev.com/).

The [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gww_4GBZnjc) that I followed for the Tetris game.
